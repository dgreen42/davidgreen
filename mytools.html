It is written in Rust. So far it works well only with Medicago truncatula but I am working to get it to work with other plant species from this data portal

                        Converts a variant call file (.vcf) which is used to store single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in a csv. You can also use it to extract the metadata form it and put it into a separate file

                        This one is a work in progress as it is not at a working version yet. But for this one I want to create a filter that can filter out SNPs based on the different filters that are included in a .vcf file
