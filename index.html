            <h2>Whats this all about?</h2>
            <p>
                Research should be accessible to anyone no matter your education level. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to create computational tools that are open source and accessible to anyone who would like to use them. They are also open to contribution. I do not know evey use case and my tools are far from perfect (if that can even be achieved). I am open to input from anyone who is willing to take the time to understand the tools that I am trying to build. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal and my mantra may be at odds with each other as not every single person at every level will find my tools to be completely accessible. Yes, they are command line tools so you will need to have some knowledge on how to use the terminal. The terminal is one of the most basic parts of a computer so everyone should have some basic understanding of how to use it. In an age of obfuscation we have become quite detatched from the basic function of the machines that we use everyday. I think a return to the basics is quite needed.
